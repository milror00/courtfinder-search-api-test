# Courtfinder Searc AP Tests

This is an example project showing how to do an api test scenario using native java hhtp libraries.

The current project is from a larger project that I completed for Court Finder at the Ministry of Justice. The intention for this project is to provoke discussion with other developers and potential employers.

This is a Maven Java project and so there are some pre-installation requirements.

This project I tested on a windows 10 64 bit machine

Java JDK-13.02
Apache Maven 3.6.3

# Install and run the project

If the above are installed then:

In your chosen IDE import this GIT project.

1. Run Maven Install  ( mvn install from cmd prompt) - this will retrieve the dependencies for the project and run the tests

If everything went well you should have 49 tests run with no failures and a build success.
